## Introduction

The Financial Wizard API is a RESTful API built using .NET Core 7.0, with Entity Framework for data access, and NUnit for unit testing. It is designed using Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles, with a Repository Pattern for handling data access and a Mediator Pattern for handling requests and responses.

The API provides functionality for managing financial transactions, allowing users to insert expenses and incomes, including recurring transactions, and to edit, delete, and read financial data. It also implements authentication and authorization, logging and error handling, and caching to improve performance.

## Development Tools and Frameworks

The following development tools and frameworks were used to build the Financial Wizard API:

- .NET Core 7.0
- Entity Framework
- NUnit
- FluentValidation
- FluentAssertion
- SQL Server
- Azure

## Architecture and Design Patterns

The Financial Wizard API is designed using Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design principles. The Repository Pattern is used to handle data access, while the Mediator Pattern is used for handling requests and responses.

## Project Structure
The Financial Wizard solution is structured into the following projects:

- **WebApi**: Contains the API controllers and startup configuration for the Financial Wizard API.
- **Application**: Contains the application logic and interfaces for the Financial Wizard API, including handlers for requests and responses.
- **Domain**: Contains the domain models and business logic for the Financial Wizard API, including repositories for data access.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the implementation of data access and other infrastructure services for the Financial Wizard API.
- **Tests**: Contains unit tests for the Financial Wizard API.

## API Functionality

The Financial Wizard API provides functionality for managing financial transactions, including the following:

- Insertion of expenses and incomes, including recurring transactions
- Editing, deleting, and reading financial data

## Performance Optimization

The Financial Wizard API implements caching to reduce database queries and improve response times. It also uses a message queue for handling high-volume transactions, and performance profiling tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

## Quality Assurance

The Financial Wizard API uses a code linter to enforce consistent coding standards, and code reviews to ensure code quality and maintainability. Automated testing tools like SonarQube are used to detect code smells and potential bugs.

## Security

The Financial Wizard API implements HTTPS and SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit. JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization, and role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to restrict access to sensitive information.

## General Topics

The sssard API is documented using OpenAPI/Swagger to improve documentation and ease of use. Dependency injection is used to make the code more modular and easier to test. Docker containers are used for deployment to improve scalability and portability. A monitoring tool is used to track server health and system performance. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate the deployment process and improve efficiency.

## Installation and Usage

To install and use the Financial Wizard API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the solution using Visual Studio or the dotnet command-line interface
3. Run the API using the dotnet command-line interface
4. Access the API using a web browser or API client
